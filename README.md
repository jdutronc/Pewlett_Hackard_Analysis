# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company of thousands of employees that has been around for a long time. Many babyboomer employees are due to retire in the next few years and we have tasked with analyzing employee data to prepare for the future: employees eligible for retirement packages, hiring needs per department and position, mentorship programs etc. Specifically in this challenge, we are to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
